# Janssen-Rollins-ABM-Replication
Replication of parts of the Agent-Based Model in Marco A. Janssen &amp; Nathan D. Rollins: Evolution of cooperation in asymmetric commons dilemmas (2007). 
Paper available at http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167268111002599.
Janssen & Rollins implemented the original model using the NetLogo programming language. This replication is coded in Python, relying on the project mesa framework for implementing ABMs in python, see https://github.com/projectmesa.

Main results are presented as a notebook, with separate files for modules including the Agent and Model classes, as well as visualization.

For a detailed description, please refer to the .pdf file. 
Code in appendixes A and B provides analyzable outputs for all included graphics. 

This project was accepted as a BSc. thesis in economics at the University of Cologne. Special thanks go to Prof. Dr. Al√≥s-Ferrer, who acted as a supervisor and provided many useful comments throughout.
