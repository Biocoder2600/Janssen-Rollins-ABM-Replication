# Janssen-Rollins-ABM-Replication
Attempt to replicate the Agent-Based Model in Marco A. Janssen &amp; Nathan D. Rollins: Evolution of cooperation in asymmetric commons dilemmas (2007). Paper available at http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167268111002599.

Janssen & Rollins implemented this model using the NetLogo programming language. This replication is coded in Python, using the project mesa framework for implementing ABMs in python, see https://github.com/projectmesa.


Please refer to the .ipynb file for a detailed description of how the model was built (in progress).
